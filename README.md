# Swift Monads

These are some of the common monads found in Swift platform or popular among the community.

Please keep in mind that these examples are *NOT* production-ready, as they not only lack of important features but also were often simplified for didactic reasons. Also, this is NOT an academic research, just a simple experiment to understand how these structures can compose well and provide small building blocks that can allow us to create more complex projects.

Again, this is *NOT* meant to be a stable product. If you feel that something is academicly incorrect please contact me or PR me.
